# Kalah Game
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arturvt/kalah-game.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arturvt/kalah-game)
## About

A Kalah based games, following the most used rules.


## Architecture

### The Controller

A REST controller that returns a JSON object with information related with the game; generally the dto with current players status.

### The game service

This service is responsible to handle all controller requests and return a DTO.
This service does not allows more than one game running in parallel.

### The Game

Game object is responsible to manage a game with two players with n-stones and 6 pits. Every play is handled by this object.


### The player object

This object has the responsibility to deal only with it's own data. It means that a player can perform a play in any 
pit and it's own house. In case of remaining stones this object shall inform to caller. The possibilities of a play:

* A regular play. Some n stones distributed in n-1 pits.
* A perfect play. The n stones is n + 1 pits (the +1 is the the house/kalah)
* A redistributed play. The n stones in z pits and the kalah. The remaining stones goes to the other player.
* A capture play. The last stone of a regular play stops in an empty pit. Player shall notify the caller that it was a
capture movement. The caller should determine which rule is going to be applied.

## Configuring the project

There is an `application.properties` file in `/src/main/resources/application.properties` where you can configure:

 - Initial stones number (6)
 - Empty House rule (true)
    - When true, a capture opponents opposite pit content when it's a capture
 - Default first player (0)
 - Remaining stones goes to owner at the end of game (false)


## Running project

### Docker

You can run the already build and published image in docker hub by running: ```docker-compose up``` from /docker path.
You also can build a new local image with gradle ou makefile.
    - Gradle: builds a new image ```gradle buildDockerImage``` 
    - Makefile: ```make build-image```and then ```make run``` or ```docker-compose up``` from /docker path


### Gradle

This project requires Gradle 4.x or higher. Use ```gradle bootRun``` to run. By default it'll be listening in port 8080.
You can change that on application.properties file.


### Jar

Run: ```java -jar core.jar``` you can find the core.jar file in $ProjectPath/build/libs after running ```gradle build```


### Web App

A small project using Angular 5 is used as a frontend. It's not fancy but usable. 
You can find the source code at: `webapp/webapp.zip` with a README with running instruction.

## Usage

### Web

Just open you browser the url: localhost:8080  and have fun. 
There is no visual feedback (like a message) when it's a capture or "you can play again", but they're working.

### API

All available API endpoints (only GET methods):

 - Home: `localhost:8080/` - this is the only method that does not returns a JSON.
 - Init a game: `localhost:8080/api/init`
 - Play: `localhost:8080/api/play/{index_id}`
    - Please note that it isn't required to determine who's going to be the player. API methods are only allowed to play some index.
    
You can look in the logs what's going on. They let the user know who's the winner.   
 
    


## For the future

- Website should return a message with info about a play, for example it the result is a Capture ou a play again.
- Improve controller unit tests.
